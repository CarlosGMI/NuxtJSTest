      At Imagenes Del Mundo we are known for the excellence of our photographs
      and as we are a bit competitive ðŸ˜‰, we have focused on which of our
      vendors has the best ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      We need <span class="highlight">your help</span> for that and you need to
      follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>In the search input, type a term or a word you want to search</li>
      <li>Click the "What's up" button</li>
      <li>
        When the results are presented to you, click on the image you like the
        most and click on the "Vote" button
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">That's it!</span> You gave 3 points to the seller
      you chose the photo from. However, this is a process that you can repeat
      until a seller gets 20 points. When you do, you will be able to create an
      invoice for that seller in Alegra and you will be able to see it!
    </p>
